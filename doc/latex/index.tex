This is a library designed for using a seven-\/segment L\+E\+D with an Arduino U\+N\+O.

This library is designed for use with a seven-\/segment L\+E\+D display, set up according to a \char`\"{}common ground\char`\"{} scheme which follows the following pin diagram (note that pin {\ttfamily dp} represents pin for the dot/period)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} - a -
|     |
f     g
|     |
 - g -
|     |
e     f    __
|     |   |dp|
 - d -     --
\end{DoxyVerb}


These L\+E\+D display pins are then expected to be connected to an Arduino U\+N\+O's digital pins according to the following table\+:
