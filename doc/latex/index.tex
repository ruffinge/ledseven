\subsection*{Overview }

This is a library designed for using a seven-\/segment L\+E\+D with an Arduino U\+N\+O.

This library is designed for use with a seven-\/segment L\+E\+D display, set up according to a \char`\"{}common ground\char`\"{} scheme which follows the following pin diagram (note that pin {\ttfamily dp} represents pin for the dot/period)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} - a -
|     |
f     g
|     |
 - g -
|     |
e     f    __
|     |   |dp|
 - d -     --
\end{DoxyVerb}


These L\+E\+D display pins are then mapped to the Arduino's digital pins using the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{structpin_out}{pin\+Out}} struct.

To get started using the library, create a {\ttfamily Pin\+Out} variable and define each of its members according to the documentation for the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{structpin_out}{pin\+Out}} struct. Then, simply call the function for the type of output you wish to display, and pass the value to be displayed along with a pointer to your pin mapping variable.

Note that, on each call to print a new value to the display, the old value will not be automatically cleared. Instead, to clear it, you must call {\ttfamily \hyperlink{ledseven_8h_abe6d5e49ec90a2d549034ecfe19e719f}{clear\+Screen(const Pin\+Out $\ast$pin\+Map)}}.
